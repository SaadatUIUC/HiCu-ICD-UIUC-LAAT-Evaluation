        "# Introduction\n",
        "The paper \"HiCu: Leveraging Hierarchy for Curriculum Learning in Automated ICD Coding\" by Weiming Ren et al. explores the use of curriculum learning to improve the automation of medical diagnosis code prediction from clinical notes. The authors focus on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding, a crucial multi-label classification task in healthcare that significantly affects clinical, epidemiological, and administrative functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are ICD Codes?\n",
        "ICD codes are standardized tools used globally for coding various diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures documented in healthcare settings. They are integral to managing patient care, conducting epidemiological studies, and facilitating healthcare billing. The automation of ICD coding is aimed at improving efficiency and reducing the potential for errors in medical documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background of the Problem\n",
        "Automated ICD coding involves the classification of textual clinical documents into ICD codes, which are used globally to classify and record diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. This coding is crucial for patient care tracking, epidemiological monitoring, and healthcare billing. The task is inherently complex due to the large number, specificity, and hierarchical structure of ICD codes. Accurately automating this process is challenging due to the nuanced and detailed information contained in clinical notes, the imbalanced distribution of codes (many codes are rarely used), and the requirement to correctly assign multiple codes to a single document.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importance and Difficulty\n",
        "The accurate assignment of ICD codes enhances the efficiency of healthcare billing, improves the accuracy of health records, and supports robust health information exchange across systems. Misclassifications can lead to incorrect treatment plans, billing errors, and improper data recording, which can have serious repercussions for patient care and administrative processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## State of the Art and Effectiveness\n",
        "Current state-of-the-art methods for automated ICD coding mostly rely on deep learning techniques, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, which can effectively handle large volumes of text data. However, these methods often treat each code as an independent label, which can lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies, particularly with rare codes. These models generally struggle with the hierarchical and imbalanced nature of the code set, leading to a lack of generalization in the prediction of less common codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Did the Paper Propose?\n",
        "The paper presents the HiCu algorithm, which employs a novel approach by using a depth-wise decomposition of the label graph and a hyperbolic-embedding-based knowledge transfer mechanism to tackle the challenges posed by automated ICD coding. This method leverages the inherent structure of medical coding systems to improve model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Innovations of the Method\n",
        "HiCu introduces a methodological innovation by applying hierarchical curriculum learning. By utilizing the structured nature of ICD codes, it provides a staged training approach that effectively combats the issues of imbalance and specificity, resulting in improved model generalization across a range of codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation of Model Efficacy Based on HiCu Learning Algorithm Enhancements\n",
        "In an assessment of the HiCu learning algorithm's impact on the MIMIC-III Full Code dataset, significant performance enhancements were reported. The metrics, averaged over 10 random runs and presented with standard deviations, demonstrate the algorithm's robustness. Re-evaluated baselines establish a foundation for comparing the performance enhancements brought by HiCu across various experimental setups. The results highlight the algorithm's ability to address the intricate challenges of multi-label classification within the domain of medical coding.\n",

        "  - **F1 Macro**: Showed an uplift from the baseline of 8.6% to 9.2% with HiCuA, 9.3% with HiCuC, and notable peaks at 11.4% with HiCuA+ASL and **<u>11.5%</u>** with HiCuC+ASL, evidencing the HiCu algorithm's strength in macro-level label discernment.\n",
        "  - **F1 Micro**: Noted an enhancement from 56.2% to 56.7% with HiCuA, holding at 56.6% with HiCuC, and reaching **<u>57.6%</u>** with HiCuA+ASL and 57.4% with HiCuC+ASL, affirming the precision in identifying the most relevant labels.\n",
        "\n",

For `LAAT with HiCuA + ASL`, the execution process is different, as specified in the LAAT section. The original authors checked the relevant file under the `LAAT` branch; however, for ease of demonstration and clarity, I decided to clone that repo into its own dedicated repository at: https://github.com/SaadatUIUC/HiCu-ICD-UIUC-LAAT-Evaluation. Once that repository is cloned locally, the relevant file is `run_50.sh` for a UNIX-like system, or the file I added, `run_50.bat`, for a Windows environment.

        "## High-Level Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "### Database Connectivity\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database to access patient data stored in the MIMIC-III database. This setup is used to query specific data directly, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on identifiers like admission IDs, which is crucial for tasks that require up-to-date and specific patient data.\n",
        "- **Why**: The database connection is essential for directly fetching structured data like discharge summaries and related diagnostic or procedural codes without needing to manually handle large datasets. This is particularly useful in medical data environments where data integrity, accuracy, and freshness are crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Retrieval and Preparation\n",
        "- **Files Used**: Uses CSV files such as `NOTEEVENTS.csv`, `PROCEDURES_ICD.csv`, and `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv` to extract and preprocess text data and medical codes.\n",
        "- **Processing Steps**: Queries discharge summaries, and extracts labels and textual data which are then processed to normalize text and codes, extracting features like chapter, three-character, and full labels from ICD codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Files Creation\n",
        "- **Purpose of Files**: Produces structured output files (`train.csv`, `valid.csv`, `test.csv`) for different subsets of the data (training, validation, testing). These files contain processed patient and admission IDs, labels, and texts formatted for downstream tasks.\n",
        "- **Why**: These files are crucial for training and evaluating models, as they contain the processed and categorized data necessary for machine learning tasks, specifically formatted to support specific model requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Label Processing and Counting\n",
        "- **Functionality**: Counts occurrences of various labels and selects top labels based on frequency, aiding in focusing model training on the most relevant labels.\n",
        "- **Output**: Generates a list of top labels which may be used to filter or prioritize data in subsequent analyses or model training phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "- After preprocessing, the data is ready for model training or further analysis. The structured outputs allow for systematic training, validation, and testing of models designed to predict medical codes from discharge summaries or similar texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of a database allows for efficient querying and processing of specific subsets of data directly from a large centralized dataset like MIMIC-III without needing to load the entire dataset into memory, which is vital for handling large-scale medical datasets efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training, Validation, and Testing Files**: These files segregate the data into distinct sets to ensure that the model can be trained on one set of data, validated on another to tune parameters, and finally tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance, which is a standard practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new data.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Running LAAT 50\n",
        "\n",
        "To execute the test `run_50.sh` if you use a UNIX-like system, or the file I added, `run_50.bat` for Windows environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem and associated configurations are defined in `configuration/config.json`. Note that each data folder contains three files: `train.csv`, `valid.csv`, and `test.csv`.\n",
        "\n",

        "The purpose of this section is to outline the specific aspects of the original study \"HiCu: Leveraging Hierarchy for Curriculum Learning in Automated ICD Coding\" by Weiming Ren et al. that I aim to reproduce. Due to resource limitations, this reproducibility effort will focus on testing selected hypotheses using a subset of the models discussed in the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Selected Hypotheses and Corresponding Experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hypothesis 1: Evaluating MultiResCNN with HiCuA**\n",
        "  - **Claim from the Paper**: The application of the HiCuA (Hyperbolic Correction Addition) significantly enhances the MultiResCNN model's performance in terms of both AUC and F1 scores. Specifically, it reports an improvement in AUC Macro from a baseline of 91.2% to 94.7%, and in AUC Micro from 98.7% to 99.1%. Additionally, it notes an increase in F1 Macro from 8.6% to 9.2%, and F1 Micro from 56.2% to 56.7%.\n",
        "  - **Experiment**: I have successfully replicated the `MultiResCNN_HiCuA` model on the MIMIC-III dataset and evaluated its performance. The outcomes, specifically AUC Macro, AUC Micro, F1 Macro, and F1 Micro, have been compared against the metrics reported in the original study to assess the reproducibility of the claimed improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hypothesis 2: Evaluating RAC with HiCuA**\n",
        "  - **Claim from the Paper**: The HiCuA method significantly enhances the predictive accuracy and performance of the RAC reader model, especially in terms of handling rare ICD codes. The paper reports an improvement in AUC Macro from a baseline of 93.0% to 94.3%, and in AUC Micro from 98.8% to 99.0%. Additionally, it notes an increase in F1 Macro from 7.9% to 8.4% and an improvement in F1 Micro from 55.4% to 56.5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Experiment**: The `RACReader_HiCuA` model training took a significant amount of time. I have successfully replicated the `RACReader_HiCuA` model on the MIMIC-III dataset and evaluated its performance. The outcomes, specifically AUC Macro, AUC Micro, F1 Macro, and F1 Micro, have been compared against the metrics reported in the original study to assess the reproducibility of the claimed improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hypothesis 3: Evaluating LAAT with HiCuA + ASL**\n",
        "  - **Claim from the Paper**: Implementing HiCuA + ASL with the LAAT model significantly enhances the model's performance in terms of both AUC and F1 scores. The paper reports an improvement in AUC Macro from a baseline of 92.0% to 94.8%, and in AUC Micro from 98.8% to 99.1%. Additionally, it notes an increase in F1 Macro from 9.7% to 10.2%, while F1 Micro remains unchanged at 57.4%.\n",
        "  - **Experiment**:\n",
        "  I have successfully replicated the `LAAT_HiCuA+ASL` model on the MIMIC-III dataset and evaluated its performance. The outcomes, specifically AUC Macro, AUC Micro, F1 Macro, and F1 Micro, have been compared against the metrics reported in the original study to assess the reproducibility of the claimed improvements.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Anticipated Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "Reproducing the models described in \"HiCu: Leveraging Hierarchy for Curriculum Learning in Automated ICD Coding\" has presented several challenges, which are crucial to document for understanding the scope and potential limitations of this reproducibility effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hardware Limitations\n",
        "- **GPU Resources**: The original study utilized a high-end setup with at least 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. In contrast, I am working with a single 4090 GPU. This substantial reduction in computational power has necessitated adjustments in the code to accommodate a less powerful system without compromising the integrity of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Software and Library Compatibility\n",
        "- **Library Mismatches**: The original implementation was designed for a Unix-like environment optimized for multi-GPU support, which has required careful adaptation to run effectively on my available hardware. Additionally, the paper used older versions of libraries and dependencies, some of which have methods that are now deprecated. Establishing a stable environment that mimics the original settings as closely as possible involved troubleshooting and configuration.\n",
        "- **Code Adaptation**: Adapting the scripts for a single GPU setup in Windows environment and ensuring compatibility with current software versions has been a meticulous and time-consuming process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Experimental Time Constraints\n",
        "- **Extended Training Times**: Some models, notably the RAC with HiCuA, have taken an inordinate amount of time to train — over 100 hours to train. This initially raised concerns about the timeframe required to finish testing all the originally identified hypotheses.\n",
        "- **Scope of Study Limitation**: Given these time constraints and resource limitations, I have decided to limit the scope of this study to three specific hypotheses:\n",
        "  - Evaluating MultiResCNN with HiCuA\n",
        "  - Evaluating RAC with HiCuA\n",
        "  - Evaluating LAAT with HiCuA + ASL\n",
        "- This approach allows for a focused and manageable replication effort, covering:\n",
        "  - 100% of the claims made about improvements to the LAAT model.\n",
        "  - 50% of the claims regarding algorithmic enhancements to the RAC model.\n",
        "  - 25% of the performance gains claimed for the MultiResCNN model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original paper outlines a total of seven hypotheses (1 for LAAT, 2 for RAC, and 4 for MultiResCNN). In my review I have tested one hypothesis each for LAAT and RAC, and one for MultiResCNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "This documentation of challenges not only highlights the difficulties faced in replicating the study but also underscores the adaptability required to overcome these hurdles. The insights gained from addressing these challenges will be invaluable in interpreting the outcomes of the reproducibility tests and understanding any deviations from the original results.\n"

        "\n",
        "This section outlines the methodology underlying my project, detailing the approach taken to adapt and test the hypotheses originally presented in the paper \"HiCu: Leveraging Hierarchy for Curriculum Learning in Automated ICD Coding.\" The initial implementation involved addressing compatibility issues with the packages and adapting the provided `.sh` scripts to `.bat` files. This adaptation was necessary to accommodate the Windows environment on the dedicated training machine, which was also used to test the hypotheses. The conversion from `.sh` to `.bat` was essential because `.sh` scripts are typically utilized in UNIX-like systems, whereas `.bat` files are native to the Windows OS, ensuring compatibility and effective execution.\n",

        "The image illustrates a structured approach to automating ICD coding by leveraging a hierarchical model. At the first level, broad categories of diseases are defined by ranges of ICD codes. The subsequent third level is more granular, where diagnosis codes are described by a triplet of integers, and procedure codes are delineated by double digits. Levels four and five further refine the classification, featuring ICD codes with precision up to one and two decimal points, respectively. This granularity enables more detailed disease categorization. Notably, some codes, particularly under the range of 740-759 and all procedure codes, diverge from the traditional ICD structure, which includes continuous code ranges at the second level. To maintain consistency within the model, an intermediary level using identical start and end points for the code range has been introduced, as depicted by paths B and C. Additionally, in instances where the dataset labels are either whole integer codes or codes with a single decimal, duplication occurs in the fourth and fifth levels to complete the code tree structure, exemplified by paths D and E in the figure.\n",

        "The model defined in the code includes several classes representing different neural network architectures for automated ICD coding. These models include configurations for handling multi-label classification with a focus on curriculum learning and label hierarchies.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Model Descriptions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LAAT (Label Attention model)**: This model, originally presented by Vu et al. (2020), employs a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network which includes a Word2Vec embedding layer and a Bi-LSTM feature extraction layer. The Bi-LSTM encoder captures contextual information from both directions of the text, producing a matrix of text representations that can be used to attend to different parts of the input sequence when predicting ICD codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MultiResCNN (Multi-Filter Residual Convolutional Neural Network)**:  Designed by Li and Yu (2020), the MultiResCNN is based on earlier work on TextCNN and ResNet architectures. It starts by converting input words into word embeddings and then applies multiple convolutional filters of different sizes, each topped with a residual layer to enhance the model's ability to capture features at various scales. These outputs are concatenated to form the final text representation matrix. The architecture is particularly adept at handling the multi-label classification inherent in ICD coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **RAC (Read, Attend and Code model)**: Introduced by Kim and Ganapathi (2021), this model is a combination of a Convolved Embedding Module and a Self-Attention Module. The Convolved Embedding Module first represents text using word embeddings followed by convolutional neural network layers, and then these representations are processed by the Self-Attention Module, which consists of a series of transformer blocks. This model is noted for its ability to handle permutation equivariance, meaning the order of the input sequence does not affect the output of ICD code assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper investigates the effect of HiCu (Hierarchical Curriculum Learning) on these models. HiCu leverages the hierarchical structure of ICD codes to enhance model training and performance, especially on rare codes which are difficult for models to learn due to the imbalanced nature of medical datasets. It applies knowledge transfer techniques and hyperbolic embedding corrections to improve performance across various metrics, including the macro and micro AUC and F1 scores .\n",

        "    - **Hyperbolic Embedding Layers:** Specific to HiCuA strategies, embedding sizes match the hyperbolic space dimensions used (commonly around 50 dimensions).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MultiResCNN:**\n",
        "  - **Convolutional Layers:** Multiple convolutional layers with filter sizes that may vary from small (3-5 words) to large (7-9 words) to capture different levels of textual granularity.\n",
        "  - **Residual Connections:** Helps in flowing gradients and avoiding the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.\n",
        "  - **Activation Function:** Uses Tanh activation functions following convolutional layers to add non-linearity.\n",

        "- **LongformerClassifier:**\n",
        "  - **Longformer Layers:** Uses a Longformer architecture, suitable for processing long text sequences with attention mechanisms that focus on different parts of the input sequence efficiently.\n",
        "  - **Configuration:** Configured with parameters such as number of attention heads, hidden dimensions (typically 768 for base models), and specific attention window sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training Objectives\n",
        "- **Loss Functions:**\n",
        "  - **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss:** Used for binary classification tasks such as ICD code prediction from clinical texts.\n",
        "  - **Asymmetric Loss:** Customized to handle imbalanced datasets, focusing more on the minority classes which are crucial in medical code predictions.\n",
        "- **Optimizer:**\n",
        "  - **Adam Optimizer:** Widely used for its efficiency in handling sparse gradients and adaptive learning rate capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Configuration\n",
        "- **Pretrained Models:** Uses pretrained Longformer or other transformer models fine-tuned on medical texts to leverage prior knowledge and improve prediction accuracy.\n",
        "- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Not directly mentioned in the paper, but could be integrated for evaluating model robustness and uncertainty in predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details\n",
        "- **Classes and Methods:** Code structure involves defining Python classes for each model type (e.g., `MultiResCNN`, `LAAT`), with methods for each operation like `forward` pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.\n",

        "- **F1 Score:** Reported in both micro-averaged and macro-averaged forms, it indicates the balance between precision and recall.\n",
        "- **Precision@K (P@K):** This metric assesses the proportion of correctly predicted labels in the top-K predictions, essential for practical applications where only the top few predictions may be considered.\n",
        "- **Precision@5 (P@5):** Measures the proportion of relevant labels in the top 5 predictions.\n",
        "- **Precision@8 (P@8):** Measures the proportion of relevant labels in the top 8 predictions.\n",
        "- **Precision@15 (P@15):** Measures the proportion of relevant labels in the top 15 predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Performance Results:\n",
        "- The HiCu method was tested on several model architectures, showing improvements in AUC and F1 scores over baseline models without curriculum learning.\n",
        "- Notable enhancements were particularly evident for rare labels, addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets prevalent in medical coding.\n",
        "- An asymmetric loss function was employed to handle label imbalance more effectively, leading to superior performance on rare and infrequent labels.\n",
        "- Extensive testing was conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset using ICD-9 codes, establishing the method's effectiveness on a standard dataset for medical coding research.\n",

        "**Method:** The model employs a diverse set of filter sizes `(3, 5, 9, 15, 19, 25)`, and this experiment analyzes the impact of each filter size on the model's ability to capture relevant features effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results:**\n",
        "- Smaller filters (sizes `3` and `5`) excel at capturing fine-grained details.\n",
        "- Mid-range filters (sizes `9` and `15`) provide the best balance between detail and context, optimizing both precision and recall.\n",
        "- Larger filters (sizes `19` and `25`) help capture broader contextual information but may lead to some over-generalization.\n",

        "## Discussion and Future Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reproducibility Assessment\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I focused on testing the hypotheses laid out for the following models based on the original paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `MultiResCNN with HiCuA`\n",
        "2. `RAC with HiCuA`\n",
        "3. `LAAT with HiCuA + ASL`\n",
        "\n",
        "While these tests do not cover all hypotheses from the original study, they were selected based on the resources available to me. **The results from these tests closely align with the claims made in the original paper, providing strong indications of reproducibility.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encountered Challenges\n",
        "#### What Was Easy:\n",
        "- Although the initial setup required some hours to complete, the process will be much more straightforward for future reproducers thanks to the `environment.yml` file that I created.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What Was Difficult:\n",
        "- The training of models, especially the RAC with HiCuA, proved to be resource-intensive and time-consuming. The need for substantial computational resources posed a considerable challenge.\n",
        "- Managing this project solo alongside other responsibilities was particularly strenuous. The absence of a collaborative team amplified the complexity and intensity of managing all aspects of the model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
        "- **For the Original Authors:**\n",
        "  - **Documentation and Setup:** Providing detailed environment setup files, such as an `environment.yml`, at the outset could significantly enhance reproducibility. This would help future researchers bypass the initial hurdles of environment configuration.\n",
        "  - **Resource Requirements:** More transparent communication regarding the computational demands and hardware specifications could prepare future researchers better, ensuring they have adequate resources before commencing the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For Future Reproducers:**\n",
        "  - **Utilize Existing Resources:** Leverage the `environment.yml` to simplify the initial setup process. This step is crucial for aligning your computational environment with the needs of the project.\n",
        "  - **Resource Allocation:** Ensure access to adequate computing resources. For reference, the original study utilized **4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs**. Matching or approximating this hardware setup could be critical for replicating the study's results effectively\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings from this study reinforce the reproducibility of the original paper's results under the constraints and configurations tested. The challenges encountered highlight the importance of resource availability and preparatory work in reproducing complex models. Future efforts in this field could benefit significantly from improved documentation and sharing of setup configurations to facilitate easier replication and extend research outcomes."
